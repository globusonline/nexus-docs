name: Group
description: Manage a specific group. The url for all groups is defined in the results of the group list.  It will follow the pattern /groups/&lt;groupid&gt; but the groupid is, at the moment, an opaque identifier.  Similarly, the urls for subresources of a group are defined by the group summary.  They will follow the same pattern of using the groupid as the identifier.
