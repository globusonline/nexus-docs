  description: |
    Nexus is the service which provides user profiles, groups and other resources for GlobusOnline.
    It also provides the interfaces for authentication with GlobusOnline.  All requests to globusonline are made in the context of a community.
    The community name is set using the X-Go-Community-Context header.

    So cURL requests to be executed in the context of a specific community would specify the header like:

    `$ curl -H 'X-Go-Community-Context: mycommunity'`

    If the community context is not set, the request will be made in the default GlobusOnline context.
