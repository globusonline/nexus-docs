    description: Show a list of groups.  Groups are hierarchical, i.e., groups can have child groups.  As such, a list of groups needs to have a base node and a depth.  The depth defines how many generations of groups should be retrieved.  So, a depth of 1 will return all of the child groups of the root, while a depth of 2 will return all of the children and grandchildren of the root group.
    query_param:
      depth: How many deep in the group tree should be returned
      root: Where in the group tree should the list start
